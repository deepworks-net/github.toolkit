# Axioms Layer

This layer contains atomic capabilities - the foundational building blocks.

## Structure
- `git/` - Git operation axioms
- `version/` - Version management axioms
- `release/` - Release process axioms
- `github/` - GitHub-specific axioms

Each axiom is defined as an FCM (Formal Conceptual Model) file.

cat > logic/README.md << 'EOF'
# Logic Layer

This layer contains compositions and relationships between axioms.

## Key Files
- `compositions.fcm` - How axioms combine
- `dependencies.fcm` - Relationship mappings
EOF

cat > patterns/README.md << 'EOF'
# Patterns Layer

This layer contains reusable workflow patterns built from logic compositions.
EOF

cat > mechanics/README.md << 'EOF'
# Mechanics Layer

This layer contains operational templates and implementations.

## Structure
- `workflows/` - GitHub workflow templates
- `actions/` - Action implementation templates
EOF

cat > reflection/README.md << 'EOF'
# Reflection Layer

This layer contains self-awareness and analysis capabilities.

## Structure
- `orchestrator/` - Self-maintenance and updates
- `analyzer/` - Capability discovery and documentation
EOF

cat > emergence/README.md << 'EOF'
# Emergence Layer

This layer contains discovered patterns and capabilities that emerge from the system.
