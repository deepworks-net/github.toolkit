# LCMCP Pattern

The **Loosely Coupled Modular Composition Pattern (LCMCP)** is a fundamental architectural pattern used throughout the GitHub Toolkit. This pattern ensures components can be combined effectively while maintaining independence and flexibility.

## Pattern Overview

LCMCP enables the toolkit's modular architecture by defining how components at different layers interact while remaining loosely coupled.

> **Note**: This documentation is currently incomplete. The LCMCP pattern is referenced throughout the codebase but needs detailed documentation from the project maintainers.

## Key Principles

Based on the name and usage throughout the toolkit, LCMCP appears to follow these principles:

### Loosely Coupled
- Components depend on interfaces, not implementations
- Changes in one component don't require changes in others
- Clear boundaries between different architectural layers

### Modular
- Each component has a single, focused responsibility
- Components can be developed and tested independently
- Functionality is organized into discrete, reusable modules

### Composition
- Complex functionality built by combining simpler components
- Higher-level components orchestrate lower-level ones
- Flexible assembly of capabilities to create solutions

## Usage in the Toolkit

The LCMCP pattern is evident in several areas:

### Layer Composition
- Atoms (generated actions) compose into Molecules (composite actions)
- Molecules compose into Organisms (workflows)
- Each layer builds upon the previous while remaining independent

### Action Design
- Actions have clear input/output interfaces
- Actions can be combined in different workflows
- Implementation details are hidden behind interfaces

### FCM Bridge System
- FCM definitions are loosely coupled from implementations
- Generated actions are modular and composable
- Bridge system enables flexible composition of capabilities

## Documentation Needed

This pattern requires additional documentation covering:

- [ ] Detailed pattern definition and rules
- [ ] Implementation guidelines for each layer
- [ ] Examples of proper LCMCP application
- [ ] Anti-patterns and what to avoid
- [ ] Testing strategies for loosely coupled systems
