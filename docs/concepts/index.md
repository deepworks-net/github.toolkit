# Core Concepts

Welcome to the Core Concepts section of the GitHub Toolkit documentation. This section provides a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts and architecture that power the toolkit.

## Overview

The GitHub Toolkit is built on innovative architectural patterns that enable scalable, maintainable, and reusable automation. Before diving into implementation details, it's essential to understand these core concepts.

## Key Concepts

### [FCM Bridge System](fcm-bridge.md)
The revolutionary approach that treats capability definitions as source code and generates GitHub Actions automatically. This is the foundation of the entire toolkit.

### [Six-Layer Architecture](six-layers.md)
Understanding the layered architecture (Axioms, Particles, Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Ecosystems) that organizes capabilities from atomic operations to complex systems.

### [Naming Conventions](naming-convention.md)
Learn about the hyphen vs underscore naming pattern and how it indicates whether components are generated or manually maintained.

### [LCMCP Pattern](lcmcp-pattern.md)
Discover the Log-Check-Modify-Check-Push pattern that ensures reliable Git operations across all toolkit actions.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Start with FCM Bridge**: Understand how capabilities are defined and generated
2. **Learn the Layers**: See how components build upon each other
3. **Understand Naming**: Recognize generated vs manual components
4. **Master Patterns**: Apply consistent patterns in your implementations

## Why These Concepts Matter

- **Consistency**: Uniform patterns across all components
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and automated generation
- **Scalability**: Layered architecture supports growth
- **Reliability**: Proven patterns prevent common errors
