# GitHub Toolkit

This repository contains a comprehensive toolkit for GitHub Actions automation, featuring a sophisticated FCM (Formal Conceptual Model) bridge system that generates actions from conceptual definitions. The toolkit provides standardized approaches for git operations, version management, and release automation.

## Getting Started

For a comprehensive understanding of the toolkit architecture and components:

- **[Understanding Actions](guides/understanding-actions.md)** - Learn about Core and Composite Actions
- **[Understanding Workflows](guides/understanding-workflows.md)** - How workflows orchestrate actions  
- **[Understanding FCM Bridge](guides/understanding-fcm-bridge.md)** - The generation system behind actions
- **[Testing Framework](guides/testing-framework.md)** - Comprehensive testing patterns and requirements

## Available Workflows

### MkDocs GitHub Pages Workflow

**[View Documentation](workflows/mkdocs-gh-pages.md)**

Automates the deployment of MkDocs documentation to GitHub Pages. This workflow:

- Copies repository files (README, CHANGELOG, LICENSE) to documentation
- Updates MkDocs navigation configuration
- Deploys to GitHub Pages
- Supports custom Python versions and file locations

### Create GitHub Release

**[View Documentation](workflows/create-release.md)**

Automates the creation of GitHub releases. This workflow:

- Creates releases from version tags
- Supports prereleases and draft releases
- Allows custom release titles
- Can be triggered manually or by tags

### Update Changelog

**[View Documentation](workflows/update-changelog.md)**

Automatically updates CHANGELOG.md when pull requests are merged. This workflow:

- Adds PR information to changelog
- Manages unreleased section
- Maintains consistent changelog format
- Runs on PR merge to develop branch

## Using These Workflows

To use these workflows in your repository:

1. Reference them in your workflow files:

    ```yaml
    jobs:
    docs:
        uses: deepworks-net/github.actions/.github/workflows/mkdocs-gh-pages.yml@main
    ```

2. Configure with input parameters:

    ```yaml
    with:
    parameter: value
    ```

3. Provide any required secrets:

    ```yaml
    secrets:
    token: ${% raw %}{{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}
    ```

## Best Practices

When using these workflows:

1. Always reference a specific tag/SHA instead of `main` for production use
2. Test workflow changes in a feature branch first
3. Monitor workflow runs for any issues
4. Keep repository settings up to date with required permissions

## Need Help?
