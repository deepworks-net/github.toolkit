# Documentation Gaps

This page tracks concepts, patterns, and features that are referenced in the codebase or mentioned in documentation but need more complete documentation.

## Critical Documentation Issues

### ⚠️ MAJOR: Potentially Fictional Content
**Status**: Needs immediate review and correction  
**Issue**: Recent documentation reorganization introduced potentially inaccurate or speculative content

**Files Requiring Validation**:
- [ ] `concepts/six-layers.md` - "Six-layer architecture" may be conceptual, not actual
- [ ] `concepts/naming-convention.md` - Overstates systematic naming patterns
- [ ] `architecture.md` - Contains aspirational rather than actual architecture
- [ ] `architecture/index.md` - Mermaid diagrams may not reflect real implementation
- [ ] `development/index.md` - References tools and processes that may not exist

**Action Required**: Review against actual codebase and mark speculative content clearly.

## High Priority Gaps

### LCMCP Pattern
**Status**: Corrected but incomplete  
**Location**: [concepts/lcmcp-pattern.md](../concepts/lcmcp-pattern.md)  
**Issue**: Corrected to "Loosely Coupled Modular Composition Pattern" but needs actual implementation details

**Needs Documentation**:
- [ ] Detailed pattern definition and rules
- [ ] Implementation guidelines for each architectural layer
- [ ] Concrete examples of LCMCP application
- [ ] Anti-patterns and common mistakes
- [ ] Testing strategies for loosely coupled systems

### Bridge System Internals
**Status**: Missing  
**Referenced In**: Various FCM and generation contexts  

**Needs Documentation**:
- [ ] FCM file format specification
- [ ] Bridge generation pipeline details
- [ ] Custom template creation
- [ ] Generator extension points
- [ ] Validation rule implementation

### Six-Layer Implementation Details
**Status**: Concept documented, implementation gaps  
**Location**: [concepts/six-layers.md](../concepts/six-layers.md)  

**Needs Documentation**:
- [ ] Specific implementation patterns for each layer
- [ ] Interface design guidelines between layers
- [ ] Error propagation patterns
- [ ] Performance considerations per layer
- [ ] Migration strategies between layers

## Medium Priority Gaps

### FCM Authoring Guide
**Status**: Missing  
**Referenced In**: Development documentation  

**Needs Documentation**:
- [ ] FCM syntax specification
- [ ] Parameter type definitions
- [ ] Output specification rules
- [ ] Version management for FCMs
- [ ] Domain organization guidelines

### Testing Framework Details
**Status**: Referenced but not fully documented  
**Location**: Mentioned in guides  

**Needs Documentation**:
- [ ] Test structure and organization
- [ ] Action testing patterns
- [ ] Workflow testing strategies
- [ ] Integration test requirements
- [ ] Performance testing guidelines

### Deployment and CI/CD Integration
**Status**: Partially documented  
**Referenced In**: Workflow files  

**Needs Documentation**:
- [ ] Complete CI/CD pipeline documentation
- [ ] Deployment strategies
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Rollback procedures

## Low Priority Gaps

### Advanced Patterns
**Status**: Missing  

**Needs Documentation**:
- [ ] Cross-repository action usage
- [ ] Complex workflow orchestration
- [ ] Error recovery patterns
- [ ] Performance optimization techniques
- [ ] Security best practices

### Tool and Script Documentation
**Status**: Minimal  
**Referenced In**: Makefile and .bridge/ directory  

**Needs Documentation**:
- [ ] Complete Makefile command reference
- [ ] Bridge script usage and options
- [ ] Development environment setup
- [ ] Debugging tools and techniques
- [ ] Custom tool creation

### Integration Examples
**Status**: Basic examples exist  
**Location**: examples/ directory  

**Needs Documentation**:
- [ ] Real-world usage patterns
- [ ] Industry-specific implementations
- [ ] Integration with popular tools
- [ ] Custom domain implementations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Documentation Quality Issues

### Concepts Needing Validation
These concepts were mentioned but may need verification:

1. **"Meta-Level Design"** - Referenced in architecture but needs verification
2. **"Self-Describing Systems"** - Mentioned but implementation details unclear
3. **"Immutable Infrastructure"** - Referenced but needs concrete examples
4. **Specific Git operation patterns** - Many referenced but not documented

### Links and References
- [ ] Audit all internal links after reorganization
- [ ] Verify external links are current
- [ ] Update cross-references between sections
- [ ] Add missing code examples

## Contributing to Documentation

### How to Help

1. **Identify Gaps**: Add new gaps to this page when you find them
2. **Contribute Content**: Pick a gap and create documentation
3. **Verify Information**: Validate existing content against implementation
4. **Improve Structure**: Suggest better organization or presentation

### Documentation Standards

When filling gaps:
- Start with a clear overview
- Include practical examples
- Reference actual code where possible
- Avoid speculation or assumptions
- Mark uncertain content clearly

### Review Process

1. Create documentation for a gap
2. Mark the gap as "In Progress" 
3. Submit for review by maintainers
4. Update this page when complete
5. Remove from gaps list when fully documented

## Tracking Progress

### Recently Completed
- [x] Workflow naming conventions (dot prefix for private workflows)
- [x] Core Concepts section reorganization
- [x] Navigation structure improvement

### In Progress
- [ ] LCMCP pattern detailed documentation
- [ ] Internal link updates after reorganization

### Needs Assignment
- [ ] Bridge system internals
- [ ] FCM authoring guide
- [ ] Testing framework details
- [ ] Deployment documentation

## Maintenance

This page should be updated regularly:
- Add new gaps as they're discovered
- Move completed items to "Recently Completed"
- Update priority based on user needs
- Remove outdated or resolved gaps

**Last Updated**: During documentation reorganization  
**Next Review**: After LCMCP pattern completion
