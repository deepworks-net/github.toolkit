# Repository Cleanup Progress

**Purpose**: Track repository cleanup - removing artifacts, empty dirs, organizing files.

---

## ✅ Completed Cleanup Tasks

- [x] Removed `-generated` suffixed directories (old FCM artifacts)
- [x] Removed development artifacts (tag-operations-stage2)
- [x] Removed loose action files in wrong locations
- [x] Removed empty placeholder directories (mechanics/, reflection/)
- [x] Removed duplicate documentation (examples/complete-action-example/docs/)
- [x] Removed migration artifacts (create-layer-structure.sh, phase2-migration-plan.md)

## 🔄 Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Review remaining root utilities (analyze-actions.py, test-bridge.sh)
- [ ] Validate documentation links still work
- [ ] Start building whitelist of approved items

## 📝 Key Understanding

- Hyphen/underscore naming is intentional (generated/manual flags)
- Most repository structure is correct as-is
- Focus on artifacts and organization, not restructuring

**Status**: Artifact cleanup mostly complete
