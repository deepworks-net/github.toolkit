## üîç Key Decisions Needed

### 1. Action Naming Convention
**Question**: Hyphen (generated) vs Underscore (manual) actions?
- **Option A**: Keep both, clearly document difference
- **Option B**: Standardize on underscores, update bridge
- **Option C**: Standardize on hyphens, update manual actions

### 2. Generated vs Manual Actions
**Question**: How to handle actions that exist in both forms?
- Clear separation of concerns
- Documentation of which is which
- Bridge system updates

### 3. Directory Cleanup
**Question**: What to do with unclear directories (claude/, mechanics/, etc.)?
- Investigate purpose
- Move to archive if unused
- Document if keeping
