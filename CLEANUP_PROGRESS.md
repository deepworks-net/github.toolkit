# Repository Cleanup Progress

**Purpose**: Track repository cleanup - removing artifacts, empty dirs, organizing files.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Cleanup Tasks

- [x] Removed `-generated` suffixed directories (old FCM artifacts)
- [x] Removed development artifacts (tag-operations-stage2)
- [x] Removed loose action files in wrong locations
- [x] Removed empty placeholder directories (mechanics/, reflection/)
- [x] Removed duplicate documentation (examples/complete-action-example/docs/)
- [x] Removed migration artifacts (create-layer-structure.sh, phase2-migration-plan.md)

## ‚úÖ All Tasks Complete

- [x] Review remaining root utilities (analyze-actions.py, test-bridge.sh) - Both kept as legitimate tools
- [x] Start building whitelist of approved items - Comprehensive whitelist created
- [x] Added action naming convention documentation to README.md

## üìã Documentation Note

- Documentation references checked - existing references are correct
- MkDocs build test requires dependencies not available in current environment

## üìù Key Understanding

- Hyphen/underscore naming is intentional (generated/manual flags)
- Most repository structure is correct as-is
- Focus on artifacts and organization, not restructuring

**Status**: Artifact cleanup mostly complete
